# CraftRoyale
A Minestom-based server implementation of Clash Royale.

## State of development
We got some basic features working like:
- Players can join the server and get assigned to a Scoreboard team.
- Players can view a list all available cards
- Players can get cards by using commands and place them
- Troops will attack each other all the time when in correct ranges

thats about it so far...

generally there are some other things like arena management and so on im working on but the focus currently lies on getting the basic troops and towers to work properly.
